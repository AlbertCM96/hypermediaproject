# hypermediaproject

in this project we will create a webpage for my own curriculum vitae

# target user profile

the target will be any potential employers that might be interested in my Curriculum Vitae.
I imagine the avererage target for my web page will be middle-aged man/woman that are currently CEOs or in the human resource team from a tech company and are looking for employees to fill up their ranks. More precisely are looking for a computer engineer.

# information architecture

There will be one single page in which all my information regarding my career and studdies, as well as my personal contact information are summarised.

i have created a visual design template in figma.com
